## About ComBat-seq

ComBat-seq is a batch effect adjustment tool for bulk RNA-seq count data. It is an improved model based on the popular ComBat[1], to address its limitations through novel methods designed specifically for RNA-Seq studies. ComBat-seq takes **untransformed, raw count matrix** as input. Same as ComBat, it requires a known batch variable.

We use a negative binomial regression to model batch effects, then provide adjusted data by mapping the original data to an expected distribution if there were no batch effects. This approach better captures the properties of RNA-Seq count data compared to the Gaussian distribution assumed by ComBat. ComBat-seq specifies different dispersion parameters across batches, allowing for flexible modeling of the variance of gene expression. In addition, ComBat-seq provides adjusted data which preserves the integer nature of counts, so that the adjusted data are compatible with the assumptions of state-of-the-art differential expression software (e.g. edgeR, DESeq2, which specifically request untransformed count data). 

ComBat-seq was recently [published in NAR genomics and bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/2/3/lqaa078/5909519). Whenever using ComBat-seq, please cite:

## Installation

This repository is **not a package** for ComBat-seq. It stores files to reproduce the results and figures in our paper.

### Install from Bioconductor

ComBat-seq is available in [Bioconductor sva v3.36.0](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sva.html)[2,3], please download and install following instructions in the link to Bioconductor sva. I am not a maintainer for the Bioconductor sva package, and may not be able to address some issues in that version (many of the issues are related to package dependencies and versions). 

### Install from GitHub

ComBat-seq is also included in [a working version of sva which I built](https://github.com/zhangyuqing/sva-devel). To use ComBat-seq from my GitHub, you will need to properly install devtools package, and download the sva package with

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zhangyuqing/sva-devel")
```


## Usage

Basic usage (users need to input at least two parameters - a raw count matrix from RNA-Seq studies, without any normalization or transformation, and a vector for batch separation):

```r
count_matrix <- matrix(rnbinom(400, size=10, prob=0.1), nrow=50, ncol=8)
batch <- c(rep(1, 4), rep(2, 4))

adjusted <- ComBat_seq(count_matrix, batch=batch, group=NULL)
```
  
In ComBat-seq, user may specify biological covariates, whose signals will be preserved in the adjusted data. If the user would like to specify one biological variable, they may use the `group` parameter:

```r
group <- rep(c(0,1), 4)
adjusted_counts <- ComBat_seq(count_matrix, batch=batch, group=group)
```
  
If users wish to specify multiple biological variables, they may pass them as a matrix or data frame to the `covar_mod` parameter:

```r
cov1 <- rep(c(0,1), 4)
cov2 <- c(0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1)
covar_mat <- cbind(cov1, cov2)
adjusted_counts <- ComBat_seq(count_matrix, batch=batch, group=NULL, covar_mod=covar_mat)
```

## Common Q&A

Thanks for trying out ComBat-seq! Though I hope to answer as many of your questions as I can, my bandwidth is quite limited, unfortunately. Please refer to the list below for guidance first before reaching out to me. Thank you for your patience to any delay in my response to questions and issues. 

> *I can't find ComBat-seq after installing.*

I do not have that issue on my end, and was able to find the function following these steps: 1) remove the previous sva installed: `remove.packages("sva")`, 2) install with devtools (see Installation section), 3) check `packageVersion("sva")` to make sure it is version 3.35.2, and 4) make sure to call function by the right name `sva::ComBat_seq`. 

If the problem persists, [others](https://github.com/zhangyuqing/ComBat-seq/issues/5) have cloned the repository, and sourced **both the ComBat_seq.R and helper_seq.R** scripts, which works for them. I do not have a better solution at the moment. 

Also, there is a auxiliary function named `vec2mat` contained in **helper_seq.R**. If you ran into any issue that R cannot find this function, helper_seq.R is where it is.

> *The function returns a list rather than the adjusted matrix.*

I have fixed this issue in the sva on my GitHub, by converting input data into a matrix. If you are using the Bioconductor version (which we hope will be updated soon), please convert the input data (`as.matrix(count_matrix)`), and make sure the count matrix has **R matrix data type**.

> *Can I use ComBat-seq to set a reference batch / adjust multiple variables / on (or to create) TPM, FPKM, other normalized data / in other creative ways?*

My first version of ComBat-seq is pretty simple. It does not allow reference batch options, and only considers 1 batch variable. There are certainly many ways to work with ComBat-seq to deal with flexible settings, so please feel free to be creative :)
